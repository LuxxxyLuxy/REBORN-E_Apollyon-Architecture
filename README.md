# Reborn-E (Engine) Apollyon Architecture

The Apollyon Archiecture is the successor to the Synchronus Architecture. The Synchronus Archiecture relied on several branches and threads synchronising from single-script architecture. Apollyon Architecture still maintains this single-script architecture from Synchronus Architecture, but uses application over reiteration to apply context to a system. Apollyon Architecture utilises several coding patterns to take heavy-load off the server and onto the client where necessary, especially in streaming and iterating leaving most rendering, final calculations, and communications to the server side. 

Apollyon Architecture has entirely reworked most of the modules to run 'smarter' calculations and forces good-habit coding. Several new modules have been added to create post-processing effects including notables ones such as dwayne (heavily overused in battlegrounds), rain, and snow ViewPort illusions (strictly client) and coding patterns that has created smarter, more intuitive, artificial intelligence. 

Apollyon Architecture is currently being implemented into Reborn Engine (REBORNE AA) as it's not compatible with base Reborn Engine.
